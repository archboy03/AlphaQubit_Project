TO DO LIST:
- Want to make sure the data we are generating is correct so we are training our model correctly
    - We should now be generating the SI1000 data correctly, however we need to check we are applying the noise model correctly 
    - Also need to look at generating XEBs DEMs 
    - In total we train on three types of simulated data with different degrees of similarity to the experimental data we get from the sycamore processor
